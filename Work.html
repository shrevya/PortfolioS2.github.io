											Fake News Detection with Machine Learning
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/shrevya/ML-portfolio" class="image featured interactable"><img src="images/fake.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In the era of digital information overload, discerning the authenticity of news has become increasingly challenging. This "Fake News Detection" project harnesses the power of machine learning to tackle this pressing issue.

										I start by compiling a vast and diverse dataset of news articles from various sources, ensuring it covers a wide array of topics and writing styles. Through rigorous data preprocessing and feature extraction, we examine linguistic patterns, source credibility, and contextual information.

										This machine learning model, built using cutting-edge natural language processing techniques and deep learning algorithms, is trained on this comprehensive dataset. It distinguishes between legitimate, fact-based news and deceptive, fabricated content with impressive accuracy.

										 By providing a reliable means of distinguishing between real and fake news, our project plays a crucial role in preserving an informed and responsible society.

										</header>
										<a href="https://github.com/shrevya/ML-portfolio" class="image featured interactable"><img src="images/hesrt.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											My "Heart Disease Classifier" project utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques to predict and categorize heart disease risk factors. I gather a diverse dataset of patient health records, cleanse and normalize the data, and select pertinent features. By employing a variety of machine learning algorithms, my predictive model is capable of classifying patients into different risk categories. This project also offers insights into the factors contributing to risk assessments, enhancing healthcare providers' decision-making. Overall, my "Heart Disease Classifier" is a valuable tool in the early detection of heart disease, contributing to improved patient care and better health outcomes.

											<h2><a href="https://github.com/shrevya/ML-portfolio">Zomato</a></h3>
										</header>
										<a href="https://github.com/shrevya/ML-portfolio" class="image featured interactable"><img src="images/food.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											In my "Machine Learning for Zomato Restaurant Success" project, I've created a powerful tool designed to equip restaurant owners and managers with data-driven insights that will enable them to thrive on the Zomato platform. The competitive nature of the food industry requires an online presence and a focus on customer satisfaction, both of which are at the core of this project's objectives. To achieve this, I've undertaken key steps, including data collection from Zomato's platform, sentiment analysis of customer reviews using natural language processing techniques, and feature engineering to extract relevant data points such as cuisine type, pricing, and location. These data are used to develop predictive models that assess factors influencing restaurant success, such as customer satisfaction and popularity. Moreover, the project includes a recommendation engine to provide actionable insights and performance analytics to help restaurant owners track changes in customer sentiment. By harnessing the power of machine learning, my project not only enhances a restaurant's presence on Zomato but also guides owners in making data-informed decisions to boost customer satisfaction, drive revenue, and ultimately achieve greater success on the platform.
